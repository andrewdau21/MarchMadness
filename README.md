# March Capness

This application provides the scoring and UI display for the annual March Madness Salary Cap Tournament.

## Background

### Contest Format
You have a $100 salary cap to buy a group of teams from the pool that are playing in the NCAA tournament. The cost of each team is determined by its seed, as shown below:
Seed

*INSERT TABLE*

Example: You can buy all 4 #1 seeds for $25 each and root for the chalk. Or you can buy a #1 seed ($25), a 2-seed ($19), a 3-seed ($13), a 4-seed ($12), a 5-seed ($11), then fill out your roster with all 4 8-seeds ($20). There are no restrictions on how you manage your cap money -- as long as you’re at or below the $100 cap, anything goes.
Your score is determined by the total games won by the teams in your group for the main tournament of 63 games that begins Thursday, March 21 (in other words, we are ignoring the play-in games (the NCAA calls them “First Four”) that are happening on Tuesday and Wednesday – they will not count towards your final win total, and you can wait until after these games happen before you pick your group of teams). At the end of the tournament, we’ll total up wins and pay out according to the structure given above. A total of around 22 wins usually takes it (the all-time record is 24 wins, done in 2014 and 2018).
